#summary Installation instructions for the TIY library (and examples) on Windows.

Tested on Windows 7 64-bit.

=Dependencies=
 * *Visual Studio 2010 / Visual C++ 10.0* from http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express
  For 64-bit use, download and install the Windows SDK (e.g. 7.1. for Windows 7 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx)

  (for other compilers some of the following steps could be different)
 * *OpenCV* (>= 2.3):
   # Download the newest Version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/
   # Run the _.exe_ file and extract
   # Create a new folder e.g. _C:\OpenCV2.4\_ and move the content of the extracted folder _opencv_ into there
   # Run _Start Menu > All Programs > Accessories > Command prompt_ as admin (right click on it and _run as administrator_) and type _command:SETX /M OPENCV_DIR C:\OpenCV2.4\build_ (or replace the directory as under point 3.)
   # Add _;%OPENCV_DIR%\x64\vc10\bin;_ for 64-bit or _;%OPENCV_DIR%\x86\vc10\bin;_ for 32-bit to the system path (in Windows 7 by right click on _My Computer_ on your desktop, select _Properties_, click on _Extended system properties_, go to the _Advanced_ tab, click on _Environment Variables_ and double click on _Path_ in the _System variables_ area)
   # Copy the files _tbb.dll_ and _tbb_debug.dll_ from _C:\OpenCV2.4\build\common\tbb\intel64\vc10\_ to _C:\OpenCV2.4\build\x64\vc10\bin_ for 64-bit and/or from _C:\OpenCV2.4\build\common\tbb\ia32\vc10\_ to _C:\OpenCV2.4\build\x86\vc10\bin_ for 32-bit
 * (Build) *Boost* (>= 1.46): 
   # Download the newest version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/
   # Unzip the folder (to e.g. _C:\boost`_`1`_`53`_`0_, but NOT into _C:\boost\boost`_`1`_`53`_`0_)
   # For 32-bit, start a MSVC command prompt (_Start_->_ALL Programms_->_Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express_), for 64-Bit (or also 32-Bit), start a SDK command prompt instead (_Start_->_ALL Programms_->_Microsoft Windows SDK v7.1_)
   # Navigate to the directory where Boost was unzipped to:
   {{{
cd c:\boost_1_53_0
   }}}
   # Build the boost builder (in x86):
   {{{
setenv /x86 /Release  // only necessary in the SDK command prompt
   }}}
   {{{
bootstrap
   }}}
   # Build boost for 32-Bit (header files: _C:\boost\include\boost-(version)_, 32(64)-bit libraries: _C:\boost\lib\boost-(version)_)
   {{{
b2 --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete install --libdir=C:\boost\lib\ --includedir=C:\boost\include\ --with-thread --with-chrono --with-regex --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-system
   }}}
   or for 64-Bit
   {{{
setenv /x64 /Release
   }}}
   {{{
b2 --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete install --libdir=C:\boost\lib\ --includedir=C:\boost\include\ --with-thread --with-chrono --with-regex --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-system architecture=x86 address-model=64
   }}}
 * *Interception*:
   # Download the installer from https://github.com/downloads/oblitum/Interception/install-interception.exe
   # Run the command prompt as admin (see point 4. under OpenCV), navigate to the directory, where the downloaded _install-interception.exe_ is located and type _install-interception.exe /install_
   # Reboot your system before the first use of the TIY library
 * *CMake* (optional - only when building TIY yourself):
  Downloadable from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

=TIY library (and examples)=

Two options are available for installation:
 * Pre-build installers: one single installation file, no building necessary
 * Build from source (based on _CMake_): further customization possible, also if no suitable installer available

==A. Pre-build installers==

The _tiy`_`client_ example can be downloaded and installed without the TIY library and on all PCs in the same network.

For TIY, download and install the newest _tiy-X.X.-win_ _.exe_ version from the [http://code.google.com/p/tiy/downloads/list Downloads] area for 64-bit (_amd64_) or 32-bit (_i386_) systems. The TIY library with the _tiy`_`server_ and _tiy`_`client_ example will be installed.

==B. Build from source==

 # Download and unzip the newest _tiy-X.X..zip_ (or the _tiy`_`client_ example) file from the [http://code.google.com/p/tiy/downloads/list Downloads] section
 # Start _CMake_ (_cmake-gui_) and select the _src_ directory as source and the _build_ directory as build
 # Click _Configure_ and choose _Visual Studio 10_ (or Win64 version fir 64-bit) as generator
 # Change the options as you want to
  * _BUILD`_`client_: the client example will also be build
  * _BUILD`_`server_: the server example will also be build
 # Click _Configure_ and then _Generate_
 # Go into the _build_ directory and open the Visual Studio project by opening _tiy.sln_
 # Change the build configuration from _Debug_ to _Release_ and build the project _PACKAGE_ (right click on it and select _Build_)
 # Now you have built an installer by yourself and can install it as under point A.
